# 💧FaucetDrops

A simple tool built to help **crypto and blockchain communities** distribute ETH or tokens easily to many people — without stress.

Whether you're doing airdrops, rewards, giveaways, or onboarding events, this faucet system saves you time and energy by handling bulk token distributions in a secure, automated, and transparent way.

## 🌟 Why This Matters for Communities

Sending tokens to a long list of members is tiring — and expensive if done manually. Our faucet system solves this by letting you:

* ✅ **Distribute tokens or ETH in one click**
* ✅ **Set who can claim and when**
* ✅ **Track who claimed across multiple blockchains**
* ✅ **Avoid sending the same user rewards twice**
* ✅ **Let multiple communities manage their own faucets**
* ✅ **Charge a small backend fee for sustainability**

## 🧩 How It Works (Simple Breakdown)

### 1. **Create Faucet**

The "control center" where new faucets are created. Think of it like opening a new tap for your community.

### 2. **Faucet**

Each faucet is like your own personal giveaway page. You decide:

* Who gets tokens (whitelist)
* When they can claim
* How much they get

You can also top it up with ETH or tokens anytime.

### 3. **Faucet Storage**

Keeps a record of all claims, across different networks. So if a user claims once, they can’t cheat by claiming again from another chain.
