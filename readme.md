## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. **Faucets**
Your primary tool for token distribution.

- **Open Drop** — Anyone with a drop code can claim
- **Whitelist Drop** — Only approved wallets can claim
- **Custom Drop** — Full control over distribution logic

Each faucet lets you:
- Set claim amounts and time windows
- Choose ETH or any ERC-20 token
- Track claims across multiple chains
- Update whitelists in real-time

### 2. **Quests**
Gamified campaigns that drive onchain engagement.

- **Multi-Stage System** — Beginner → Intermediate → Advance → Legend → Ultimate
- **Task Types** — Social follows, content creation, onchain transactions, NFT holding
- **Automatic & Manual Verification** — Choose how tasks are verified
- **Leaderboards** — Real-time rankings of top contributors
- **Reward Tiers** — Equal or custom tiered reward distributions

### 3. **Live Quizzes (Multiplayer)**
Real-time competitive quizzes where Web3 knowledge translates directly into rewards, powered by high-speed WebSockets.

- **Multiplayer Lobbies** — Players connect wallets, set usernames, and wait in the lobby until the host triggers the start sequence.
- **Speed-Based Scoring** — Earn a fixed 1,000 base points for correct answers, plus up to 1,000 bonus points based on how fast you answer. 
- **Reward Distribution** — Hosts can distribute the prize pool equally among top winners, scale it quadratically, or set custom percentage tiers (e.g., 1st: 50%, 2nd: 30%).
- **AI & PDF Creation Tools** — Generate full quizzes instantly using AI prompts, or upload a whitepaper/PDF to auto-extract key facts into a study-based competition.

### 4. **Challenges (1v1 Duels)**
Fast-paced knowledge duels where players stake and earn on-chain.

- **Stake & Earn** — Wager a minimum of 10 DROPS in 3-round AI-generated trivia matches. The winner takes the pool!
- **DROPS Economy** — Use Game DROPS to play, and earn Reward DROPS from victories. 
- **Redeem & Stake (APY)** — Redeem Reward DROPS for GoodDollar ($G). 75% of the value is paid to your wallet, while 25% is auto-staked for 30 days yielding up to 35% APY based on your player tier.
- **Rematch Badge** — Play 10 games to unlock. Removes stake caps, allows free pre-lobby stake negotiations, and enables rematches.
- **Weekly Rank Rewards** — The top 3 players on the global leaderboard claim exclusive rewards from the Duel Faucet every week.

### 5. **User Profiles & Dashboards**
Personalized spaces for creators and participants.
